# Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Combinatorial Optimization

The propose of this project is to solve combinatorial optimization problem with hierarchical reinforcement learning approach.

## Pointer-Net-Reproduce
Reproduce the result of pointer network.

## HRL-for-constrained-TSP
Solve TSP with a simple constraint by hierarchical RL framework. The implemtation is based on pointer networks.
